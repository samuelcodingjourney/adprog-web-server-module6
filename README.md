### Commit 1 Reflection notes
The code inside handle_connection method firstly have a parameter of mut stream: TcpStream which is to take TcpStream that is named stream and the mut keyword tells that the stream can be modified in the function. The first line which is let buf_reader = BufReader::new(&mut stream) would create a buffer reader to read bytes from the stream or from the TcpStream. The let http_request: Vec<_> = buf_reader.lines() would return an iterator thanks to the lines() method and that those would be read from buf_reader later stored to http_request. The .map would unwrap the result returned after .lines(), the .take_while collect lines until an empty line is encountered, and also the .collect() is used to collecet those lines into the vector. The types of vector elements are infered by Rust when notation of Vec<_> was used. Finally, the println is used at the end to print to the console of the collected result of the HTTP request that is in the vector containing the lines of the HTTP request from TCP stream.
