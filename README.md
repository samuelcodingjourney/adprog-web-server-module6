## Module 6
### Commit 1 Reflection notes
The code inside handle_connection method firstly have a parameter of mut stream: TcpStream which is to take TcpStream that is named stream and the mut keyword tells that the stream can be modified in the function. The first line which is let buf_reader = BufReader::new(&mut stream) would create a buffer reader to read bytes from the stream or from the TcpStream. The let http_request: Vec<_> = buf_reader.lines() would return an iterator thanks to the lines() method and that those would be read from buf_reader later stored to http_request. The .map would unwrap the result returned after .lines(), the .take_while collect lines until an empty line is encountered, and also the .collect() is used to collecet those lines into the vector. The types of vector elements are infered by Rust when notation of Vec<_> was used. Finally, the println is used at the end to print to the console of the collected result of the HTTP request that is in the vector containing the lines of the HTTP request from TCP stream.

The changed version of handle_connection adds status_lilne variable to represent HTTP status line. It also has let contents = fs::read_to_string("hello.html").unwrap(); that reads the html file of hello.html and turn it to a string. The let length = contents.len() would then calculate the length of that contents string. The formatting for the response would be used to format the HTTP response that includes the status line, content length header, and also the contents of the file itself. The response would then be written to the TCP stream by converting the response string to bytes using as_bytes() and write them to the stream as in the line of stream.write_all(response.as_bytes()).unwrap(). Basically the added things to the handle_connection function is to generate a HTTP response because of the reading of the file hello.html.

The changes done in handle_connection is firstly on removing the way to store the request to a vector but just using request_line just to get only the first line in the HTTP request. This would be used in the if condition to check if the GET request to the path is equal to the request_line otherwise the request was done for other path such as in this case 127.0.0.1:7878/bad. In each condition, a status line would be created for both condition of the correct request and the opposite and also the reading to string of the respective html files and one of them is the 404.html for the wrong request handling in the else condition. The response would then be formatted to be then turned to bytes and write to stream. The refactoring was done because on both if and else condition, the web server would format the response and write to stream on both conditions. The refactoring was needed to seperate the changes made which are just setting up the different values for status_line and filename for the html page to be set in the content of the body of the respond to be different in regards to the condition. The formatting of the response and writing to stream could then be put outside the conditions so that it would not get repeated two times and if some updates on the code to change how the file reading and response writing work can be done on only one place that is outside of the if condition and else ccondition blocks of code.
